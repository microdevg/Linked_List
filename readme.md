# Doubly Linked List Implementation

This repository contains code for implementing a doubly linked list in C. A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a data part and two pointers to the next and previous nodes in the sequence.

## Implemented Functions

1. **Create List**: Initializes a new doubly linked list.
2. **Append**: Adds a new node to the end of the list.
3. **Remove Last**: Removes the last node from the list.
